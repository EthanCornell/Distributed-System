# Distributed System Projects

Explore collaborative, scalable solutions for networked applications with the following projects:

1. ## [Concurrent Webserver](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Concurrent-webserver)

   **Overview:** This project involves developing a concurrent web server. Initially, a non-concurrent web server code is provided, and the task is to make it multi-threaded to handle multiple requests concurrently. The goals include understanding the basic architecture of a web server, adding concurrency to a non-concurrent system, and effectively reading and modifying an existing codebase.

2. ## [Distributed File System](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Distrbuted-Filesystem)

   **Overview:** In this project, you will develop a working distributed file server. The project provides minimal UDP communication code, and the rest needs to be built. The file server operates as a stand-alone UDP-based server, waiting for messages, processing them, and replying to clients accordingly.

3. ## [Peer-to-Peer Application with Gossip Protocol in C++](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Gossip-protocol)

   **Overview:** Building a small peer-to-peer (P2P) application in C++ involves understanding required functionality, protocols, testing, and documenting the implementation. Functional requirements include peer discovery, message exchange, peer-to-peer communication, concurrency, and error handling. Implementation guidelines cover networking, threading, and serialization.

4. ## [MapReduce](https://github.com/EthanCornell/MapReduce)

   **Overview:** This project entails developing a MapReduce framework tailored for a word counting task. The objective is to implement a master server responsible for orchestrating workers, delegating tasks, and aggregating results. Tasks involve processing large text files, ignoring non-Latin symbols, and converting text to lowercase. Participants are required to craft their own map and reduce functions for this purpose.

5. ## [MapReduce System Implementation in Go](https://github.com/EthanCornell/MapReduce-in-Go)

   **Overview** This project entails developing a MapReduce system, similar to the one described in the MapReduce paper. We'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions, handles file I/O, and a coordinator process that distributes tasks to workers and manages failures. This README guides you through the setup and implementation of the system.

6. ## [Key/Value Server]()
  
7.  ## [Raft]()

    **Overview:**
    7a. leader election
    7b. log
    7c. persistence
    7d. log compaction
8.  ## Fault-tolerant Key/Value Service

    **Overview:**
    8a. Key/value service without snapshots
    8b. Key/value service with snapshots

9.  ## Sharded Key/Value Service
