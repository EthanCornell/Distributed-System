# Distributed System Projects

Explore collaborative, scalable solutions for networked applications with the following projects:

1. [Concurrent Webserver](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Concurrent-webserver)

   **Overview:** This project involves developing a concurrent web server. Initially, a non-concurrent web server code is provided, and the task is to make it multi-threaded to handle multiple requests concurrently. The goals include understanding the basic architecture of a web server, adding concurrency to a non-concurrent system, and effectively reading and modifying an existing codebase.

   **Useful Reading:** 
   - Intro to threads
   - Using locks
   - Producer-consumer relationships
   - Server concurrency architecture

2. [Distributed File System](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Distrbuted-Filesystem)

   **Overview:** In this assignment, you will develop a working distributed file server. The project provides minimal UDP communication code, and the rest needs to be built. The file server operates as a stand-alone UDP-based server, waiting for messages, processing them, and replying to clients accordingly.

3. [Peer-to-Peer Application with Gossip Protocol in C++](https://github.com/EthanCornell/Gossip-protocol)

   **Overview:** Building a small peer-to-peer (P2P) application in C++ involves understanding required functionality, protocols, testing, and documenting the implementation. Functional requirements include peer discovery, message exchange, peer-to-peer communication, concurrency, and error handling. Implementation guidelines cover networking, threading, and serialization.

4. [MapReduce Project](https://github.com/EthanCornell/MapReduce)

   **Introduction:** This project entails developing a MapReduce framework tailored for a word counting task. The objective is to implement a master server responsible for orchestrating workers, delegating tasks, and aggregating results. Tasks involve processing large text files, ignoring non-Latin symbols, and converting text to lowercase. Participants are required to craft their own map and reduce functions for this purpose.
